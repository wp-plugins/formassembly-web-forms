= Example Shortcodes =

FormAssembly Professional, Premier, & Basic Plans - (tfaforms.com):
[formassembly formid=123456]


FormAssembly Enterprise Cloud Edition - (Most commonly: organization.tfaforms.net):
[formassembly formid=123456 server="http://your.server.tld"]

Publish with an iframe - (Inline Frame):

If you'd rather display the form in an inline frame, or if your server doesn't support the default publishing method, add the iframe attribute to your tag.

For instance, a benefit to using an iframe would be to avoid conflicting CSS rules between the parent site and the embedded form.
[formassembly formid=123456 iframe=1]

OR

[formassembly formid=123456 server="http://your.server.tld" iframe=1]

Publish a Workflow:

[formassembly workflowid=1234]

Add Style:

It is possible to add CSS to your shortcode to control the size of the form/iframe in the page. For example, you can define the width:
[formassembly formid=123456 iframe=1 style="width: 300px !important;"]
